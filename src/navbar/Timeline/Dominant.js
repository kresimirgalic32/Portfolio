        Dominant is an automated industrial plant where wooden crates are
        manufactured. They are mainly used for fruits and vegetables. While I
        was working at the automated station I would be finishing unfinished or
        defective crates when I had the time.

      <h3 className="third-text">
        Working in an automated industrial plant I realised how strong the power
        of teamwork is. It also made me realise that machines do not wait for
        you to finish, they just keep going, so keeping pace was really
        important.
