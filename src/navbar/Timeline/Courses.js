        My first course was at Cultural Center "King Fahd" Mostar in Adobe
        Illustrator. Right after my first course I enrolled in Solidworks and
        Adobe Photoshop. Once I finished those two courses, I began thinking
        about 3D modelling for games, which led me to Zagreb, to Machina Game
        Dev Academy where i finished a course in Blender.
