        Graphic design and 3D modelling My first course was at the Cultural
        Center "King Fahd" Mostar in Adobe Illustrator. Right after my first
        course I enrolled in Solidworks and Adobe Photoshop. Once I finished
        those two courses, I began thinking about 3D modelling for games, which
        led me to Zagreb, to Machina Game Dev Academy where I finished a course
        in Blender.
